      "Content": "Day 1\n\nWe meet at our designated pick up point and en route to our hotel we visit the\n\nNational Trust\u2019s Hughenden Manor near High Wycombe, home of Victorian Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli from 1848 until his death in 1881. Most of his\n\nfurniture, books and pictures remain in this, his private retreat from the rigours of parliamentary life in London. We continue to the 3* Novotel in Ipswich for a\n\nfive night stay on half board basis.\n\nDay 2\n\nOur Blue Badge guide meets us at our hotel this morning and accompanies us\n\nthroughout the day. This morning we visit the National Trust\u2019s Sutton Hoo, an Anglo Saxon royal burial site where the priceless Sutton Hoo treasure was\n\ndiscovered in a huge ship grave in 1939. We continue to the picturesque 16th\n\ncentury fishing village of Aldeburgh and subject to availability we visit The Red\n\nHouse, where Britten and Pears lived and worked from 1957 until their deaths. The Gallery features an engaging permanent exhibition that introduces visitors\n\nof all ages to Britten and his music, and the interiors of the House have been re-\n\npresented as they were in the mid-1960s, as has the historic Library room.\n\nDay 3\n\nWith our Blue Badge guide we visit Lavenham this morning. Here you may\n\nchoose to visit the National Trust\u2019s Guildhall on an individual basis, an early 16th century timber framed building that dominates the Market Place. We enjoy a\n\nguided tour of Constable Country this afternoon, located on the Suffolk and Essex border and renowned as the birthplace of artist John Constable. Our\n\nguided tour of East Bergholt takes in sights such as John Constable\u2019s Studio and St Mary\u2019s Church, built in the 15th and 16th centuries and renowned for the absence of a tower or spire to house the bells. We continue to Dedham where our guided tour takes in sights such as Constable\u2019s School and Dedham Parish Church, dedicated to St Mary the Virgin in 1492 when the present building was begun. Here we visit The Munnings Collection at Castle House. Sir Alfred Munnings\u2019 (1878-1959) prolific career as an artist spanned nearly seventy years, and he spent over half of those working and living at Castle House, the house of his dreams, in the heart of the Dedham Vale. We then visit the National Trust\u2019s Bridge Cottage at Flatford. Located upstream from Flatford Mill, Bridge Cottage houses an exhibition on John Constable, several of whose paintings famously feature this property.\n\nDay 4\n\nOur guided tour of Bury St Edmunds this morning takes in sights such as St Edmundsbury Cathedral, a place of worship for nearly 1,000 years. We continue this afternoon with our Blue Badge guide to the National Trust\u2019s Ickworth House, located in 70 acres of stunning gardens and 1,800 acres of idyllic \u2018Capability\u2019 Brown parkland. Dominated by its huge central Rotunda dating from 1795, Ickworth is home to a fine collection of Old Master paintings, silver and Regency furniture.\n\nDay 5\n\nWe enjoy an included scenic two and a half hour cruise with our Blue Badge guide this morning, taking in the most beautiful wooded stretches of the River\n\nOrwell. We continue on to the English Heritage\u0027s Framlingham Castle, an enchanting 12th century castle that dominates the town. It was here that Mary Tudor waited to hear whether she or Lady Jane Grey had been declared queen after the death of Edward VI.\n\nDay 6\n\nAfter checking out of our hotel and before returning home we visit the National Trust\u2019s Polesden Lacey near Dorking, an Edwardian country estate designed to be the perfect setting for a millionairess hostess to entice royalty, politicians and the best of Edwardian society for entertaining weekends in the country.\n\nNB:- Please note we reserve the right to alter the above itinerary if required for operational\n\nreasons. Given the historic nature of the places visited, a certain degree of walking will\n\nbe involved, and this holiday may not be suitable for those with mobility problems.\n\nVie w a nd sha r e this to u r o nlin e - click o n Vie w Yo u r To u r at w w w.tailo r ed-tr a v el. c o . uk a nd qu ote e x nt151",
