# Design Workflow

The end-to-end workflow for using Figma to iterate on UpDoc's UI.

## The Process

```
Capture → Edit → Read → Implement
```

### 1. Capture

The user captures the current Umbraco backoffice UI using the [html.to.design](html-to-design.md) Figma plugin. This creates an editable Figma frame representing the live state of the UI.

**Best practice:** Capture only the specific panel or component you want to iterate on, not the entire backoffice screen. Smaller captures = fewer Figma nodes = less token consumption when Claude reads it back.

### 2. Edit

The user rearranges, adds, or removes elements directly in Figma:

- Move components to different positions
- Add placeholder text or labels for new elements
- Delete elements that should be removed
- Annotate with notes about intended behaviour

No design skills required — the goal is communicating intent, not producing polished mockups.

!!! note "Claude cannot edit Figma designs"
    The Figma MCP plugin cannot modify individual elements. All visual editing must be done by the user in Figma. See [Figma MCP — Bidirectional](figma-mcp.md#bidirectional--but-not-element-level-editing) for details.

### 3. Read

Claude reads the modified design using [Figma MCP](figma-mcp.md) tools.

**Step 1:** Select the modified area in Figma and copy the link:

- **Desktop app:** Select the layer → press **Ctrl+L**
- **Browser:** The URL updates automatically with `?node-id=XX-YY`

**Step 2:** Paste the link to Claude. Claude extracts the node ID and reads just that targeted area.

**Step 3:** Claude uses the appropriate tool:

- **`get_screenshot`** — always start here. Gives Claude visual understanding of the layout changes with low token cost
- **`get_metadata`** — only if structural details are needed (exact node hierarchy, positions, sizes). High token cost.
- **`get_design_context`** — only when ready to generate implementation code. High token cost.

### 4. Implement

Claude translates the design changes into Lit/UUI code, following UpDoc's existing patterns and Umbraco's component library.

The Figma MCP's code output is React + Tailwind — this is a **reference only**. Claude adapts it to the project's actual stack (Lit web components, UUI/Umbraco elements, CSS custom properties).

## Validated Examples

### First iteration — successful (Feb 2026)

- Captured the Extracted tab showing section boxes with badges
- User rearranged badge positions in Figma
- Claude read via `get_screenshot` + `get_metadata`
- Claude implemented the layout changes in Lit

### Second iteration — token issue (Feb 2026)

- Captured a much more complex view (config toolbar + hierarchical tree)
- `get_metadata` on the full frame consumed too much context
- **Root cause:** The frame had 3-5x the node count of the first iteration
- **Fix:** Should have targeted individual sections (toolbar OR tree, not both)

### Targeted node test — successful (Feb 2026)

- Selected the "Icons and Text" frame in Figma desktop (node `16:1141`)
- Copied link with Ctrl+L, pasted URL to Claude
- Claude called `get_screenshot` on just that node
- Result: clear image showing config toolbar + section tree, low token cost
- **Validated:** targeted reads solve the token problem

## Tips

- **One area at a time** — capture and iterate on one component or section per cycle
- **Screenshot first** — `get_screenshot` is usually sufficient for Claude to understand changes
- **Name your Figma nodes** — if you rename elements in Figma, those names appear in metadata and help Claude understand intent
- **Keep the Figma file organised** — use separate frames for different areas of the UI rather than one giant frame
- **Copy link, not node ID** — in Figma desktop use Ctrl+L to copy the link. Claude extracts the node ID from the URL automatically
