## When to Use Skills

- **Before implementing any extension type** — invoke the skill first to see official patterns
- **Before writing tests** — use `umbraco-testing` to choose the right approach
- **When something doesn't work** — skills may reveal configuration or registration steps you missed

## Critical Lesson: Skills Are Supplementary

!!! warning "Always verify against the Umbraco CMS source code"

    Skills provide excellent starting guidance, but the **Umbraco CMS source code** is the definitive reference. The local clone at `d:\Users\deanl\source\repos\Umbraco Extensions\Umbraco-CMS` must be consulted for:

    - How Umbraco itself implements similar features
    - The actual API signatures and expected behaviour
    - Edge cases not covered in documentation

    **Lesson learned (Feb 2026):** Multiple attempts to implement a collection create option failed because only skills/docs were consulted. The CMS source code revealed the extension point didn't exist in v17. Significant time and tokens were wasted.

### The Right Workflow

1. **Invoke the skill** — get the official pattern and example code
2. **Search the CMS source** — find how Umbraco implements the same extension type internally
3. **Compare and adapt** — use the skill's pattern but verify details against the source
4. **Implement** — with confidence that the approach actually works
