# up-doc-workflow-source-view.element.ts

Workspace view for the Source tab in the workflow workspace. Displays the four-level extraction hierarchy (Page > Area > Section > Text) and the transformed content view.

## What it does

Displays the sample extraction for a workflow in two modes:

- **Extracted** — area detection hierarchy showing pages, areas (colour-coded), sections (with headings), and individual text elements with metadata
- **Transformed** — assembled sections with pattern detection (bullet list, paragraph, sub-headed, preamble) and mapping controls

Users can include/exclude sections (via toggle), include/exclude pages, map sections to destination fields, collapse/expand any level, and re-extract from a different source PDF.

## How it works

### Layout pattern

Uses `umb-body-layout header-fit-height` with a single `slot="header"` div containing `uui-tab-group` for view switching (Extracted / Transformed). Info boxes and content are in the scrollable area below.

```html
<umb-body-layout header-fit-height>
    <div slot="header" class="source-header">
        <uui-tab-group><!-- Extracted / Transformed --></uui-tab-group>
    </div>
    <div class="info-boxes"><!-- uui-box cards: Source, Pages, Areas, Sections --></div>
    <div class="collapse-row"><!-- Collapse All button, right-aligned --></div>
    <!-- scrollable content -->
</umb-body-layout>
```

### Info boxes (uSync-inspired)

Four equal-width `<uui-box>` cards in a flex row with `flex-grow: 1`, following the uSync dashboard pattern. Each box uses the `headline` attribute for its title label.

1. **Source** — h2 filename, document icon, extraction date, Re-extract and Change PDF buttons
2. **Pages** — stat number (e.g., "2 of 4" or "All"), "Choose Pages" button opens page picker modal
3. **Areas** — stat number, "Edit Areas" or "Define Areas" button opens area editor modal
4. **Sections** — stat number, "Edit Sections" button that opens a section picker popover listing all transform sections. Each menu item shows `icon-check` (green) if the section already has rules, or `icon-thumbnail-list` (default) if not. Clicking a section opens the Section Rules Editor modal.

All boxes use equal-height layout via `min-height: 180px` on `.box-content` with `margin-top: auto` on `.box-buttons` to pin buttons to the bottom. Stat numbers are vertically centred using flex. All buttons use `color="default"` for consistent styling.

The Collapse All / Expand All button sits in its own row below the boxes, right-aligned.

### Page selection

Users can filter which PDF pages are extracted. Stored in `source.json` as a `pages` array of page numbers. Page selection is managed via the "Choose Pages" button in the Pages info box, which opens a page picker modal. Selection is saved immediately and applied on next re-extract.

### Data loading

On load, the component:

1. Consumes `UMB_WORKSPACE_CONTEXT` and observes the `unique` value (workflow name)
2. Loads in parallel: sample extraction, area detection, workflow config, transform result, source config
3. Initialises page selection state from source config
4. If sample extraction and area detection exist, automatically triggers a fresh transform to ensure data is current
5. Stores all in state for rendering

### Extracted mode (area detection hierarchy)

Elements are displayed in a four-level collapsible hierarchy:

1. **Page** — `uui-box` with "Page N" headline, section/area counts, page include toggle, and collapse chevron in `header-actions` slot. Excluded pages are dimmed.
2. **Area** — colour-coded left border with area name label, section count, and collapse chevron. Areas with rules show an "N rules" badge and "Edit Rules" button. Areas without rules show a "Flat"/"Configured" structure badge and "Define Structure"/"Redefine" button plus an include/exclude toggle. For areas with rules, composed sections from the transform pipeline are rendered instead of raw elements, showing role name, content preview, and mapping status badges.
3. **Section** — structural label "Section – {name}" with include/exclude toggle, element count, and collapse chevron. The heading text from the PDF is rendered as the first child element (with a HEADING badge), not as the section header itself. This separates our structural UI from the actual PDF content. Preamble sections (no heading) show "Content" as the structural label.
4. **Element** — individual elements with semantic role badge (Heading/List Item/Paragraph), font size, font name, and colour badges.

### Collapse behaviour

All four levels are collapsible via a consistent chevron icon (`icon-navigation-right` when collapsed, `icon-navigation-down` when expanded). The chevron is always the rightmost element in each row.

State is managed by a single `_collapsed` Set with key prefixes:
- Pages: `page-${pageNum}`
- Areas: `area-p${pageNum}-a${areaIndex}` or `area-p${pageNum}-undefined`
- Sections: `p${pageNum}-a${areaIndex}-s${sIdx}`

A **Collapse dropdown** (using `uui-button` + `uui-popover-container` + `uui-menu-item`, matching Umbraco's "Create" dropdown pattern) provides per-level toggle controls:

- **Expand All** — opens everything
- **Collapse/Expand Pages** — toggles all page-level items
- **Collapse/Expand Areas** — toggles all area-level items
- **Collapse/Expand Sections** — toggles all section-level items

Each label dynamically flips based on current state (e.g., "Collapse Areas" → "Expand Areas" when all areas are collapsed). The include/exclude toggle uses `@click stopPropagation` to prevent also triggering collapse.

### Transformed mode

Shows assembled sections from the transform pipeline as individual `uui-box` cards:

- Each section is a `uui-box` with the section heading as the headline
- **Simple sections** (single content part): one body row with rendered Markdown content on the left and mapping badge + Map button on the right
- **Multi-part sections** (heading + complex content): separate rows within the box for title and content, each with its own badge + Map button, separated by horizontal border lines
- Map buttons are hidden by default and appear on box hover (like Umbraco's block grid editor)
- Mapped sections show a green left border and green `uui-tag` badges with an "x" button to unmap directly
- Markdown content is rendered as HTML via `markdownToHtml()` — headings, bullet lists, blockquotes, and inline formatting are all visible

### Section rules editing

The "Edit Sections" button in the Sections info box opens a popover section picker. The picker lists all transform sections (built from area detection data) as `uui-menu-item` entries. Selecting a section opens the `UMB_SECTION_RULES_EDITOR_MODAL` sidebar, passing the section's elements from area detection. When the modal returns saved rules, they're persisted via the `saveSectionRules()` API.

The section-to-element lookup walks area detection pages to find elements belonging to each transform section, matching by section ID (kebab-case for headed sections, `preamble-p{page}-a{area}` for preamble sections).

### Mapping

From the Transformed view, users can map section parts (title, content, description, summary) to destination fields. Each mappable part has its own Map button that opens `UMB_DESTINATION_PICKER_MODAL`. Results are saved to `map.json` using source keys in the format `${sectionId}.${partSuffix}` (e.g., `features.title`, `features.content`). Mapped parts show green `uui-tag` badges with an "x" button for inline unmapping. Mapped sections get a green left border on the `uui-box`.

### Empty state

When no sample extraction exists, shows a centered prompt with "Choose PDF" button.
